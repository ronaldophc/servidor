How to setup?

1) Start the server!
  -Linux: Run `.\start.sh` or `bash start.sh` to start the server.
  -Windows: Run `start.bat`. Do **not** delete the PowerShell (ps1) files!
  -MacOS: Run `.\start.sh` or `bash start.sh` to start the server.

2) If you are using a server hosting server such as Bisect, ignore step 1. Instead just drag "mods" "configs" "kubejs" and "defaultconfigs" into the server hosting files. Make sure to install the correct version of Java and forge on the server.

3) Enjoy!

Important Notes:

1) This modpack contains MANY world-gen mods. It's highly recommended to pre-gen
your world before playing. Check out how to pre-gen:

2) Set View Distance and Simulated Distance from 6-12. If your server seems to peak
in either RAM or CPU Usage, lower simulated distance to 3-4.
